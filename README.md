**Project Title:** AI Enabled Fitness Analyzer

**Description:**

The project is to introduce Diet-Fit, an application that combines a diet planner and exercise tracker.The application detects exercise poses, counts repetitions. Aim to improve overall fitness levels and promote healthier lifestyle choices.


**Software Requirment:**

**Programming Language**: Python 
**Computer Vision Libraries:** OpenCV and Mediapipe 
**Data Processing Tools:** Pandas
**Development Environment:** IDEs VScode 
**User Interface Development:**HTML/CSS and Flask frameworks

**Explanation:**
    Developed Diet-fit an application combining a diet planner and exercise tracker to improve overall fitness and promote healthier lifestyle choices.
    **Project Intergration:** 
    Implemented real-time exercise pose detection and live counting using camera input with MediaPipe, and OpenCV, 
    Tensorflow, numpy. Utilized HTML, CSS for the frontend; Python for machine learning; Pandas for data manipulation; and Flask framework 
    for the backend. Integrated diet planning with exercise tracking for a holistic fitness approach.
    
  Get information from user personal details like height, weight, diet paln based on user information. the program process the data to calculate BMI(Body mass index) value by help of numpy and pandas. Based on     BMI level the app give diet plans by pre define plans. if user before start the exercise the app ask what workout you should do. how many cout you should do. then the app track the user using OpenCV algorithm    by help of camera. implement pose detection algorithm with help of **MediaPipe, Tensorflow**. these algorithm track the user exercise count. onces count reach the user input it give alert. also it give alert     if user workout in wrong pose.

**Future Enhancment:**

**Social Sharing and Community Features:** Implement social sharing functionalities that allow users to share their exercise achievements, progress, and challenges with friends and join fitness communities for motivation and support.

**Virtual Coaching and Training:** Introduce virtual coaching and training sessions where users can access instructional videos, virtual classes, and personalized coaching sessions led by fitness professionals to improve their technique and motivation
